THE WOLF OF WALL STREET


Project Summary

The Wolf of Wall Street is about attaining data of certain companies and providing an electronically generated credit score, it can be useful to gain a privately owned company’s credit rating in the market or get an idea of what company to invest in to get returns.


Problem Statement

When it comes to choosing the right stock it is really hard, there are no right or safe ways to invest in a company which will provide a promised return. This made all the Financial companies provide a credit report for each and every company which helped the bank approve loans, investors invest in bonds and the company to create their rankings in the market amongst their competitors. The limitation with these credit reports are, that these credit reports are provided at a certain cost with no definitive resultant. A customer investing would like to have a definitive resultant if the report is provided at a cost.


Solution - Desired Output

Here we can provide a technology which can calculate the companies credit rating as a credit rating company would provide, which will also give the investors an idea if the company is worth investing or not. Not only that we will be analysing the data of Fortune 500 companies and will provide a credit rank for those companies stating how and why are they at this certain ranking and how can they be a safe bet to invest in.
Overall we are giving a two way service to the customers, One, with providing a credit rank with their own data and Two, we can provide a credit


 THE WOLF OF WALL STREET - rating of the Fortune 500 companies which will analyse and provide outputs for the customers to understand more about their market and competition.
Project Limitations
For the purpose of the project there are going to be few limitations such as,
• The credit rating would be from the details provided, it won’t be 100% accurate as the credit rating changes from market to market, but it could give a clear idea of the company’s position in the market
• The end result would be providing if the if this company is worth investing or not, but it won’t be giving you proper details as of it won’t be connected to the live stock market.
• The data provided will the one which is available only in the public record and the sample mock run of the inputs will be the same, private companies data would not be provided in this.
